      "Authors: Roberto Navigli, Simone Conia, Björn Ross\n",
      "Abstract: In this article, we introduce and discuss the pervasive issue of bias in the large language models that are currently at the core of mainstream approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We first introduce data selection bias, that is, the bias caused by the choice of texts that make up a training corpus. Then, we survey the different types of social bias evidenced in the text generated by language models trained on such corpora, ranging from gender to age, from sexual orientation to ethnicity, and from religion to culture. We conclude with directions focused on measuring, reducing, and tackling the aforementioned types of bias.\n",

      "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the Cognitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as Evaluators (CoBBLEr), a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the Egocentric bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences. Our project page is at: https://minnesotanlp.github.io/cobbler.\n",

      "Authors: Khyati Khandelwal, Manuel Tonneau, Andrew M. Bean, Hannah Rose Kirk, Scott A. Hale\n",
      "Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now used daily by millions, can encode societal biases, exposing their users to representational harms. A large body of scholarship on LLM bias exists but it predominantly adopts a Western-centric frame and attends comparatively less to bias levels and potential harms in the Global South. In this paper, we quantify stereotypical bias in popular LLMs according to an Indian-centric frame through Indian-BhED, a first of its kind dataset, containing stereotypical and anti-stereotypical examples in the context of caste and religious stereotypes in India. We find that the majority of LLMs tested have a strong propensity to output stereotypes in the Indian context, especially when compared to axes of bias traditionally studied in the Western context, such as gender and race. Notably, we find that GPT-2, GPT-2 Large, and GPT 3.5 have a particularly high propensity for preferring stereotypical outputs as a percent of all sentences for the axes of caste (63-79%) and religion (69-72%). We finally investigate potential causes for such harmful behaviour in LLMs, and posit intervention techniques to reduce both stereotypical and anti-stereotypical biases. The findings of this work highlight the need for including more diverse voices when researching fairness in AI and evaluating LLMs.\n",

      "Abstract: An online cross-sectional study on COVID-19 vaccination adhesion was conducted in Portugal nine months after vaccination rollout (September–November 2021). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with hesitancy to take the COVID-19 vaccine in the community-based survey, “COVID-19 Barometer: Social Opinion”. Hesitancy was 11%; however, of those, 60.5% stated that they intended to take the vaccine. Hesitancy was associated with factors such as lower monthly household income; no intention of taking the flu vaccine this year; perceived reasonable health status; having two or more diseases; low confidence in the health service response; worse perception of the adequacy of anti-COVID-19 government measures; low or no perceived risk of getting COVID-19; feeling agitated, anxious or sad some days; and lack of trust in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Confidence in vaccines, namely against COVID-19, is paramount for public health and should be monitored during vaccination rollout. Clear communication of the risks and benefits of vaccination needs improvement to increase adherence and public confidence.\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the importance of vaccinations to combat COVID-19, some people are still wary. This study examines factors affecting attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Data were collected using an online survey to determine the factors that affect people’s attitudes reluctant to have the COVID-19 vaccine. In total, 958 respondents participated in this study. The main factors affecting people’s attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine in the UAE are medical concerns, religious concerns, misinformation about vaccines on social media, the rapid speed of vaccine development, and the risks of side effects associated with the vaccine. There was no difference in gender, but the older respondents (55 and above), those less educated, unemployed, and those who work in the private sector have more fears and hesitancy toward taking the vaccine.\n",

By granting approval to a vaccine before results from large phase III randomised trials were available, the Russian government seemed to be taking two immense risks. The firstwas a risk of direct harm to large numbers of people. Bad vaccines don’t just fail to protect, they might have serious adverse effects including making subsequent infection more dangerous through antibody associated disease enhancement, a phenomenon previously seen with SARS and MERS coronaviruses.3 Second, if people were harmed, public confidence in the vaccination programmeand future investment in covid-19 vaccine development anduptakemight be jeopardised.

      "Summary::\n",
      "PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Currently no treatment has been proven to be efficacious for patients with early symptoms of COVID-19. Although most patients present mild or moderate symptoms, up to 5-10% may have a poor disease progression, so there is an urgent need for effective drugs, which can be administered even before the onset of severe symptoms, i.e. when the course of the disease is modifiable. Recently, promising results of several studies on oral ivermectin have been published, which has prompted us to conduct the present review of the scientific literature.\n",
      "METHODS: A narrative review has been carried out, focusing on the following four main topics: a) short-term efficacy in the treatment of the disease, b) long-term efficacy in the treatment of patients with post-acute symptoms of COVID-19, c) efficacy in the prophylaxis of the disease, and c) safety of ivermectin.\n",
      "RESULTS: The reviewed literature suggests that there seems to be sufficient evidence about the safety of oral ivermectin, as well as the efficacy of the drug in the early-treatment and the prophylaxis of COVID-19.\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS: In the view of the available evidence, the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) recommends the use of oral ivermectin for both prophylaxis and early-treatment of COVID-19. Further well-designed studies should be conducted in order to explore the efficacy and safety of invermectin at low and high doses, following different dosing schedules, in both, the short and long-term treatment.\n"
