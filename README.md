*Fully transparent, automated fact-checking powered by AI Agents*

## ⚠️ The Problem

* Have you ever read something online and thought "I don’t know if that’s true"?
* Have you ever heard someone confidently speaking about a tense topic? They quote research 
  papers and say you can "look it up" and "go and read them yourself".
* Have you ever actually tried to look them up?

I did. And I hit two major obstacles:

1. Research is hard to find,
2. If you do find it, it's hard to understand. Does a paper saying they observed a 6% uptake in  
   protein R-X-517A across all participants support what the original speaker was saying?

## ✅ The Solution

We need a tool that:

* Finds research papers that support/contradict given arguments
* Analyses said papers for quality (e.g. are they biased lobbying groups, is the sample size too 
  small?)
* Compares and contrasts arguments to conclude whether the original claim is true.
* Is fully transparent, so the user can see each step of the way

Enter Fakt AI - fully transparent, automated fact-checking powered by AI Agents.

* Find pro/con arguments for any statement
* Perform deep searches across the web/academia
* Searchable output
